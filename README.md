# pizza
Simple angularjs front end with RESTful api using Spring boot, MVC and data rest.

Build with maven from the project root using the following commands:

mvn package

Then run the jar under target as so:

java -jar target/pizza-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

If you wish to change the port number you can update the src/main/resources/application.yml file and update the server.port.
